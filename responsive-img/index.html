    <p>I am fairly sure that this is working the way that I want it to, however I may be struggling to see. I
        rewatched the lecture to make sure and I read the articles but for some reason Github isn't linking the pathway that
        it normally does and it is throwing me off. I also validated it and it said nothing was wrong so I am crossing my fingers that
        I learned this correctly.
