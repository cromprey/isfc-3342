    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--hey thomas!-->
    <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="Meme - Interesting Man" class="img-right">The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The <i>alt</i> attribute is typically used to help people with visual impairements and also is used for screen readers. The use of <i>title</i> is used to declare the title of a document, or to give extra information about an element. It is not 
      a description for screenreaders, but acts more as a little extra fact!</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Term: Example</dt>
      <dd>Definition: be illustrated or exemplified.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
